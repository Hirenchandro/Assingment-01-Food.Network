            <p><strong>A</strong> healthy diet is essential for good health and nutrition. It protects you against many
                chronic
                noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and
                consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for
                healthy diet.</p>

            <h3>Recipie for Crispy food</h3>
            <p>You can use a neutral oil, like peanut or canola, but I like to use extra-virgin olive oil for an added
                layer of flavor. Gently lay the smashed 'taters into the hot oil, and listen for that sizzle. Let them
                cook on each side until they're golden brown and crispy, about 4-5 minutes per side.</p>

            <h3>Recipie for Meat</h3>
            <p><strong>Cook</strong> the meat until it gets soft and gives a half-cooked texture. Scoop out the flesh
                and keep it aside in a separate pot. When the pan empties, then you can add the vegetables and cook
                until they get crispy. Make sure your veggies do not steam and stay crisp.</p>

            <h3>Recipie for Soup</h3>
            <p><strong>T</strong>he essentials are vegetables and stock, plus olive oil or butter and some salt and
                pepper. After that,
                all is optional. I usually add some aromatics — onion, garlic, or leeks — and some fresh herbs. You can
                flavor the vegetables with smoked salt or spices, like curry powder or cumin</p>
